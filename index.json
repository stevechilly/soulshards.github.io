Arcadia is considered quite an outlier: not only is it the only known settlement in the region large enough to be considered a city, it is also the only settlement not regularly plagued by creature attacks. Many settlers have made the trek to Arcadia in the hopes of starting a new life there, free from the horrors and isolation in the rural areas. Arcadia began as a dwarven village nestled against the base of a mountain range but has expanded considerably over time. The city limits now extend to the coast, providing the city with a port and easier access to trade with other settlements. The city is bursting at the seams and, as a result, many new settlers have resorted to living in a tent city outside the established city limits, choosing safety over comfort. Given the number of citizens and settlers in and around Arcadia, the city guard has earned a reputation for having no tolerance for crime in an effort to preserve peace and security in the city. Notable sites:\nThe Iron Vault - bank of Arcadius The Crucible - a prison holding the most dangerous criminals and creatures in the land The Deepstone Den - dwarven tavern The Eternal Forge - forge/smithery built into the mountainside Silverglow Archive - Library, central repository of knowledge Mithril Bazaar The docks ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/locations/arcadia/","section":"Locations","summary":"The Dwarven Capital","title":"Arcadia"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/characters/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Characters"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/characters/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Characters"},{"content":" ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/characters/","section":"Characters","summary":" ","title":"Characters"},{"content":" ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/creatures/","section":"Creatures","summary":" ","title":"Creatures"},{"content":"Flesh mimics are created from corpses of those heavily corrupted individuals.
