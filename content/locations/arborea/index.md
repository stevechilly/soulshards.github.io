Arborea is a secret elven village hidden deep in the Elderwood. Concealed by Fey magic, Arborea is nearly impossible to find by outsiders and appears as a dense, impassible thicket. However, those with a strong enough connection to the World Mother can easily locate the entrance. 

Arborea itself is composed of a number of trees interconnected with a single, large tree. The largest, central tree contains many hollows and offers housing the hundreds of elves living in the village. 

The central tree of Arborea is sustained by the vessel of the World Mother, who has been embedded deep within the trunk. The symbiotic relationship between the World Mother and the central tree provides enough fey magic to keep the village hidden from outsiders and from the creatures of the Elderwood. 

The travellers were led to Arborea by Notrick and were welcomed for their deeds in rescuing him and saving the village from a bandit attack.
