title: Arcadia
showSummary: true
summary: The Dwarven Capital
---
The bustling port city, home predominantly to the dwarves and humans. Arcadia is considered quite an outlier: not only is it the only known settlement in the region large enough to be considered a city, it is also the only settlement not regularly plagued by creature attacks. Many settlers have made the trek to Arcadia in the hopes of starting a new life there, free from the horrors and isolation in the rural areas. 
  

Arcadia began as a dwarven village nestled against the base of a mountain range but has expanded considerably over time. The city limits now extend to the coast, providing the city with a port and easier access to trade with other settlements. 

  

The city is bursting at the seams and, as a result, many new settlers have resorted to living in a tent city outside the established city limits, choosing safety over comfort. Given the number of citizens and settlers in and around Arcadia, the city guard has earned a reputation for having no tolerance for crime in an effort to preserve peace and security in the city.
