**Escape from the Darkthicket**

The group spends a restless night in the forest, waiting for the captured bandit to regain consciousness. Questioning the bandit, they learn he and his gang were sent by someone by the name of ‘Thrain’ and that they were hired to recover a mysterious, ancient tome wrapped in flesh. Bartleby, perhaps out of cruelty or to prevent loose ends, brutally dispatches the bandit.

Searching his body, Hiddon discovers a dagger with a pale, yellow gem in the hilt and a strange copper coin featuring orcish text and raised numbers that seem to be gradually decreasing.

As they prepare to leave, they feel a faint rumbling in the ground and notice that a red moon is rising in the sky. As they begin to hear shrieks and bestial croaking in the distance, they decide to make haste to Arborea under Notrick’s guidance. Pushing their way through a thicket, Frodo unwittingly alerts a fleshy monstrosity that drops from the canopy above. It rises up from its mound and forms a horrific creature with scythes made of bone for arms and jagged maw in its chest. During the battle, Frodo receives an infected gash across his chest, spreading dark, spidery growths under his skin. The group realizes they are outmatched by this creature, but are saved by the intervention of a mysterious character that Heddon suspects as another changeling. 

  

Fearing the approaching creatures, Notrick suggests a detour to an isolated cabin in the woods. Upon entering the cabin, they meet Gertrude, an elderly elven woman who tends to their wounds and allows them to stay and rest in her cabin while they wait out the ‘Blood Moon’, during which the creatures of the forest become agitated and aggressive. Gertrude tells them that the creatures they’ve heard are ‘gaunts’, horrific, eyeless creatures that lie dormant under the earth. They stream out of chasms in the earth’s crust and attack anything they encounter. Everyone heals completely during their stay at the cabin. A salve is applied to Frodo which heals his infection but dredges up memories of a love that was lost in a cave-in. 

  

The group says their goodbyes and they depart. The route becomes more unyielding due to the thick vegetation and eventually the route you are being led through seems impassable. Notrick leads the way, passing through the shrubbery as if it wasn’t there. The group passes through, entering the hidden village of Arborea.
