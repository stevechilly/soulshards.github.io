Within the canopy of Arborea resides a colony of pixies. Originally residing in the fey wilds, several of these tiny creatures made their way through to this world when the elves returned after the last cataclysm. Since then, their numbers have multiplied and the majority have taken residence in the trees with the wood elves.Â 

Their presence is welcome among the elves, as their dung is incredibly nourishing to vegetation and has aided the elves in encouraging tree growth and rebuilding their home.
