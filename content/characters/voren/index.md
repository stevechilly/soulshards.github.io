Voren was the mercenary leader of a ruthless group of bandits. He and his crew were responsible for attacks on unsuspecting caravans traveling through the Elderwood. 

Voren was hired to retrieve an ancient elven tome that was stolen by Notrik, the elf. He tracked Notrik traveling on one such caravan and ordered his crew to kill anyone aboard, in hopes of quickly recovering the tome. 

Though unsuccessful in this attempt, he continued tracking Notrik northward and stumbled into the hidden village of Arborea. Mounted on a flame salamander and accompanied by one of his crew, he held an elven child hostage in exchange for the tome but was quickly dispatched by three of the elf's traveling companions.
