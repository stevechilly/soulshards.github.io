Whitman is a slim, middle-aged human man with a meticulously neat appearance and a serious, business-like demeanour. Residing in Arcadia, he acts as a liaison for the mysterious ‘Thrain’ and is responsible for communicating orders to those operating for them. 

Whitman is known to have hired the mercenary, Voren, and his crew to retrieve the ancient elven tome from Notrick, the wood elf.
