Briar is the leader and stern protector of the elves in the village of Arborea. She is also the mother of Notrick.Â 

Initially distrusting of outsiders, the travellers gained her trust by rescuing her son from mercenaries in the woods and protecting the village from attackers. She is indebted to the three and offered sanctuary and a home to them as repayment for their assistance.
