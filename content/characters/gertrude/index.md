Gertrude is an aged wood elf and is, notably, the only known wood elf not residing in Arborea. She was exiled from Arborea long ago and lives alone in a cabin in the woods. Her only known contact from Arborea is Notrick, the scout, who often visits on his patrols. 


When Notrick was captured by mercenaries during his recovery of the ancient elven tome, he led his rescuers to Gertrude’s cabin, where they rested and recovered from their injuries. 

  

Gertrude is an accomplished botanist and has a garden of herbs and plants she uses to craft healing salves
