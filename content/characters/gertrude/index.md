Gertrude is an aged wood elf and is, notably, the only known wood elf not residing in Arborea. She was exiled from Arborea long ago and lives alone in a cabin in the Elderwood. Her only known contact from Arborea is Notrick, the scout, who often visits on his patrols. 

When Notrick was captured by mercenaries during his recovery of the ancient elven tome, he led his rescuers to Gertrude’s cabin. Recognizing Notrik among the group, she welcomed them into her home and provided sanctuary against the creatures during the Blood Moon. She allowed the party to stay long enough to recover from injuries gained while traveling the woods. 

Gertrude is an accomplished botanist and has a garden of herbs and plants she uses to craft healing salves
