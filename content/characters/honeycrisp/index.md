Honeycrisp is the lorekeeper and librarian of the elves in Arborea. Her bookstacks contain texts that have been recovered by the elves on scouting missions in the woods and its surrounding areas. The books in her collection contain a wealth of knowledge that had previously been lost to the world. 

  

Honeycrisp is also an aspiring potion brewer. Given the appropriate components, she may be able to brew specialty potions for travellers.
